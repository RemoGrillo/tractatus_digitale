# Tractatus Digitale
An interactive bi-dimensional digital edition of the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus by Ludwig Wittgenstein.

###About the book
This twentieth-century masterpiece of meta-philosophy striked me in the same amount for its content and its form.
Behind the apparently-linear form of the book (behind the often oversighted proposition numbers) there is a wonderful architecture of logical beauty and of exegetical importance.
Each and every proposition fits into a precise spot within a tree-like hierarchical structure, where it can have a parent proposition, siblings, children.
Every relation of this kind is of fundamental importance.
Many relations, in the linearity of the book version, are lost.
(Nonetheless, the mono-dimensional form of the book shows false connections.)

###This Digital Version

> The thinker is like the draftsman who wants to represent in his drawings all possible connections. - L.W.

This minimal tool allows the reader to show connections between propositions directly and clearly.
A click on a proposition will show its children on the following column: there are five columns, each for every depth level of the Tractatus.
Siblings and parent propositions will still be visible and close, to allow a bi-dimensional read of the work.

###Other Digital Versions

As for any idea I have, I later find that there are dozens of people who realized something similar before me (which is, in some sense, a good sign).
Here is a list of the ones I found:
